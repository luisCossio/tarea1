# Neural Network
Autor: Luis Cossio

Implementation of a generic Neural Network algorithm 

## Tasks
1. Implementation of plotting of loss of trainning and validation sets. 
2. Used of sklearn version of MNIST dataset.  
3. Implementation of normalization.
4. Implementation of one hot encoding transformation.
5. Implementation of confusion matrix.
6. Implementation of k-Fold Cross-Validation.
7. Trial of different sizes of Hidden layer. This is available only in the jupyter notebook example

## Libraries
numpy sklearn matplotlib


## Installation
### Install python
In order to install the programing language follow the installation instructions in the official site:

https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

### Install Pip
In case of not having an installation tool, it is recommended install pip, following the instruccions of the official site:

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/

### Install libraries
To install the libraries just run the next code in the commando line using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Install jupyter notebook
The file tarea1_example.ipynb is a type of file known as a jupyter notebook, and in order to use it, it's necessary to download a program with an integrated jupyter notebook editor, such as anaconda:

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ 


## Deployment
To use the neural network just run the python program with the following command, referencing this folder:
```
python NeuralNetwork.py 
```
This loads the dataset, split it and normalize it. Then trains the network, show the confusion and matrix and plot the error,
