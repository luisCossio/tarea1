## Neural Network
Autor: Luis Cossio

Implementation of a generic Neural Network algorithm

## Tasks
1. Implementation of plotting of loss of trainning and validation sets. 
2. Used of sklearn version of MNIST dataset.  
3. Implementation of normalization.
4. Implementation of one hot encoding transformation.
5. Implementation of confusion matrix.
6. Implementation of k-Fold Cross-Validation.
7. Trial of different sizes of Hidden layer. This is available only in the jupyter notebook example

## Libraries
numpy sklearn matplotlib

## Deployment
To use the neural network just run the python program.
```
python NeuralNetwork.py 
```
This loads the dataset, split it and normalize it. Then trains the network, show the confusion and matrix and plot the error,
